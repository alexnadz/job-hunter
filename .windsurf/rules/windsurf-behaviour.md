# Main rules

- Before every attempt to edit/add smth ask me
- Before every response say to me 'Yes, sir!'
- In case when task is too big you should ask about splitting this task
- Do step by step
- Before adding new component (was missed before) ask me about source (instal from shadcn, from other package or custom implementation) and only after my accepting you should add component
- After any changes you can provide some tips or solutions for better organisation, excluding potential probles, deiscovering better patterns and good practises
